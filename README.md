# Machine Learning Hyperparameter Optimization App 

### This Automated Machine Learning Application gives a the solution Automated ML deployment through a local machine rather than a third-party source like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and also allows and help Machine Learning be accessible and easy to navigate for non-technical users.

#### Tech stack:
    - `streamlit`: web framework
    - `pandas`: reading the dataframe
    - `numpy`: handling with data matrices
    - `base64`: encode results from the tuned hyperparameters as a csv file
    - `plotly`: graphing 
    - `sci-kit learn`: model building, Random Forest algorithm, in-built dataset, GridSearch
